# Privacy Policy

This browser extension is designed to work entirely offline. It does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information.

## Data Collection
- No personal data is collected, processed, shared, or sold.
- No analytics, tracking pixels, or telemetry are used.
- The extension does not make network requests to external services. It only reads a packaged local resource (`regions.json`) to resolve region names.

## Permissions
- The extension requests no special permissions. Both Chrome and Firefox manifests declare an empty `permissions` list.

## Processing
- Generated and validated national codes are computed locally in your browser.
- Region detection uses locally packaged data and runs entirely on-device.

## Storage
- The extension does not persist any data in `localStorage`, `chrome.storage`, or `browser.storage`.
- No data is retained after use.

## Clipboard
- Clipboard writes occur only when you explicitly click the “Copy” button. The extension never reads from the clipboard and never copies content without your action.

## Third-Party Services
- The extension does not interact with third-party services, APIs, or ad networks.

## Changes to This Policy
- If this policy changes, updates will be published alongside the extension’s source code and release notes.

## Contact
- For questions or concerns, please open an issue in the project repository.
